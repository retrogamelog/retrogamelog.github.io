Basic Overview and Release Information</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Title and Regional Differences</strong></p><ul><li><strong>North American Version:</strong> “Batman: The Video Game”</li><li><strong>Japanese Version:</strong> 「バットマン」<br>Depending on the region, the cover design, title font, and release dates vary slightly. The game was first released in Japan on December 22, 1989, and in North America in 1990. The European version was unveiled in the latter part of 1990.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Development and Publishing</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Developer/Publisher:</strong> Sunsoft</li><li><strong>Key Personnel:</strong><ul><li><strong>Designers:</strong> Kazutomo Mori, Tadashi Kojima, Yoshiaki Iwata, Noriko Sakai, etc.</li><li><strong>Programmers:</strong> Keiichi Suzuki, Hiroaki Higashiya, etc.</li><li><strong>Music Composer:</strong> Naoki Kodaka<br>At the time, Sunsoft created several Batman games for various consoles based on Tim Burton’s 1989 Batman film, with the NES version being the most well-known.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><hr><h2 id=2-development-and-production-background>2. Development and Production Background</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Differentiation from the Film Motif</strong><br>Although the game is officially linked to the 1989 Batman film, its actual plot deviates significantly from the movie’s storyline. Based on the dark Gotham City of the film, the game features newly designed levels and enemy characters.</p></li><li><p><strong>Prototype and Revision Process</strong><br>The early prototype version included a 1UP icon, different cutscenes, and originally featured Firebug as the final boss. The development team revised the artwork, dialogue, and boss character lineup to better reflect the film’s atmosphere; the final version emphasizes the final showdown with the Joker in the Gotham Cathedral Belltower.</p></li></ul><hr><h2 id=3-game-system-and-features>3. Game System and Features</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Platform and Genre</strong><br>This is a platform game for the NES, consisting of a total of 5 levels. Each level takes place in different environments of Gotham City (streets, chemical plant, sewers, laboratory, and the cathedral belltower), and each concludes with a boss battle.</p></li><li><p><strong>Gameplay Mechanics</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Character Abilities:</strong><br>In addition to his basic attacks, Batman is equipped with a <strong>wall jump</strong> ability—a rare feature in NES platformers—which allows him to avoid obstacles or scale heights. In fact, failing to utilize the wall jump often results in taking damage.</li><li><strong>Weapon System:</strong><br>Batman uses three types of projectile weapons. By pressing the <strong>Start</strong> button, the weapon is cycled sequentially.<ul><li><strong>Batarang:</strong> Functions like a boomerang; it is designed to be thrown at enemies and return to BATMAN.</li><li><strong>Spear Gun:</strong> Shoots a short, pointed spear at enemies.</li><li><strong>Dirk:</strong> Fires in three split directions, capable of attacking enemies over a wide area.<br>All these weapons consume a limited “pellet item” resource and must be managed according to the situation.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Level Structure and Boss Battles:</strong><br>Each level features various obstacles, enemies (including DC comic villains such as Deadshot, KGBeast, Maxie Zeus, Heat Wave, etc.), and minions. The final boss battles take place at the top of the Gotham Cathedral’s belltower, where Batman faces the Joker.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Graphics and Sound</strong><br>The game boasts sophisticated pixel art that overcomes the limitations of NES hardware, along with a somewhat dark yet pleasing background score composed by Naoki Kodaka. The design features colors and intricate backgrounds that complement the film’s dark atmosphere.</p></li></ul><hr><h2 id=4-detailed-level-structure-and-walkthrough>4. Detailed Level Structure and Walkthrough</h2><p>Gotham City is preparing for its 200th Anniversary Festival, but widespread crime and violence have left its citizens in a state of unease. At the center of this chaos is the Joker, who is spreading nerve gas to plunge the city into terror. In these dire circumstances, the only person capable of saving the city is Batman. As the player, you assume the role of Batman to thwart the Joker’s schemes and save Gotham City.</p><h3 id=41-gotham-city>4.1 Gotham City</h3><ul><li><strong>Overview:</strong><br>Batman embarks on his adventure in the dark, deserted streets of Gotham City to investigate the “DDID Nerve Gas Scandal.”<ul><li><strong>Main Street:</strong> The journey begins on the main street of the dark urban center, where Batman traverses empty streets and abandoned roads.<ul><li>There is nothing special here, so practice using your weapons or punching as you progress.</li></ul></li><li><strong>High-rise Area:</strong> A shopping mall background emerges with high-rise buildings in the foreground, showing a desolate landscape dominated by skeletal structures of buildings and the steel framework of highways.<ul><li>At 3:10, the Mobile Home Mine begins to pose ongoing challenges: when approached, it rushes forward and explodes, so time your jump carefully from a safe distance.</li><li>At 3:25, you’ll see repeated use of the wall jump as the game progresses; all high places require this technique.</li><li>At 3:41, using a variation of the wall jump lets you bypass platforms quickly.</li><li>At 4:30, you encounter the ninja <strong>K.G. Beast</strong>; quickly close in and use rapid punching to defeat him. If Batman’s punches are slow, the enemy will counter with flashy skills.</li></ul></li><li><strong>In Front of City Hall:</strong> At 4:40, you reach City Hall, located at the heart of Gotham, where Batman engages in a final battle with the boss “Killer Moth.”<ul><li>At 4:49, throwing just the batarangs at the right timing allows for an easy clear.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h3 id=42-axis-chemical-factory>4.2 Axis Chemical Factory</h3><ul><li><strong>Overview:</strong><br>Batman takes on his next challenge at the Joker’s hideout, the Axis Chemical Factory.<ul><li><strong>Liquid Waste Floor:</strong> At 5:30, you must traverse the factory floor that handles chemical waste.<ul><li>Here, the platforms become smaller and the number of enemies increases, so using your weapons is advisable. Pellet item replenishment is manageable.</li><li>At 5:57, normally there is a platform at the far right that lets you climb to a second level, but by jumping here, you can reach the second level without going too far.</li><li>At 6:30, this section requires you to jump down and use the wall jump immediately to avoid taking damage (the video shows a failure due to poor timing). Such trap mechanisms recur throughout the level—be cautious.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Spark Floor:</strong> At 6:51, in an area with power panels supplying energy to the entire factory, watch out for electric hazards.<ul><li>At 7:02, you can clear the area by using a wall jump without moving too far.</li><li>At 8:08, after jumping off, use a wall jump to successfully pass.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Conveyer-Belt Floor:</strong> At 8:31, you must dodge moving obstacles on the conveyor belt where chemical substances are refined.<ul><li>At 8:39, you can replenish pellet items and health along the way.</li><li>At 9:41 to 9:54, note that a normal jump does not allow for direction change—so you need to jump carefully to avoid getting hit by the saw blades.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Nerve Center:</strong> At 10:23, in the final section, Batman must avoid security traps and destroy the “Machine Intelligence System.”<ul><li>At 10:25, sitting and using the spear gun can hit two cannons simultaneously.</li><li>At 10:37, if you prefer solving it with punches, execute a stationary jump.</li><li>At 10:55, due to low health, approaching from afar and using the spear gun is recommended.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h3 id=43-underground-conduit>4.3 Underground Conduit</h3><ul><li><strong>Overview:</strong><br>After destroying the Chemical Factory, Batman is caught in the Joker’s trap and dropped into the underground sewer network (the Underground Conduit), which is a sewage system connecting Gotham City. Here, Batman must find the secret exit, the Underground Cavern. The water flowing through the conduit supplies power to the Underground Station in the cavern.<ul><li><strong>Underground Conduit I:</strong> At 11:52, you immediately encounter one of the worst enemies of the game, Jader.<ul><li>At 11:56, as Jader jumps, quickly move to the opposite side and use your punch. This method is extremely risky, as Jader’s jump path and pattern are unpredictable (likely an intentional design to increase difficulty). If you hesitate, you take heavy damage. In this video, a failure results in significant damage.</li><li>At 12:54, although this is a glitch-like technique, it works best: after partially revealing Jader on screen, use the spear gun to dispatch him.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Underground Conduit II:</strong> At 13:46,<ul><li>At 14:51, you can replenish pellet items and health in this section.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Underground Cavern:</strong> At 16:16,<ul><li>This area presents no particular difficulty.</li><li>However, at 16:55, an enemy (EEV) fires a cannon from off-screen; be cautious of such areas.</li><li>At 17:43, you have another opportunity to replenish pellet items and health.</li><li>At 19:13, the right wall must be climbed using a wall jump; beware of vents scattered throughout—if you fail to control your jump strength, you will take damage.</li></ul></li><li><strong>The Electrocutioner:</strong> At 20:21,<ul><li>This boss, like Jader, has an unpredictable pattern, making him one of the more challenging foes.</li><li>His signature move, the Moon Attacker, has no safe way to avoid while on the ground—so staying on the upper platforms is the safest tactic.</li><li>At 20:31, when he charges from left to right, dodge left off the platform to avoid damage.<ul><li>At 21:11, mistiming will result in taking damage.</li></ul></li><li>After performing a jump during his charge, a stationary jump is followed by using punches.</li><li>Although not shown in the video, if you have ample health, approaching closely and using only the batarang can secure an easy victory, as The Electrocutioner’s health is not very high.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h3 id=44-laboratory-ruins>4.4 Laboratory Ruins</h3><ul><li><strong>Overview:</strong><br>Through the polluted Laboratory Ruins—another hideout of the Joker—Batman advances to the next stage.<ul><li><strong>Research Laboratory:</strong> At 22:14, this area exhibits future-engineered biological samples created by genetic engineering.<ul><li>Jader appears here as well, posing a significant threat; judge your movements based on your remaining health.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Storage Room:</strong> A nearly empty warehouse filled with scattered research tools and equipment.<ul><li>At 25:33, Heatwave appears in an unusual location; use a batarang while wall jumping to eliminate him, or alternatively, use the dirk from the opposite side.</li><li>At 26:22 to 26:31, employ a wall jump to overcome traps.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Thermal Processing Plant:</strong> At 26:43, a section that uses extremely hot flames to process waste.<ul><li>A successful punch is required here for Batman to avoid taking damage.</li><li>From 29:00 onwards, conventional methods do not suffice; you must utilize wall jumps to move both vertically and horizontally, taking care to adjust your jump strength to avoid traps and enemy fire.</li></ul></li><li>At 29:24, ascending directly leads to a shortcut, but be cautious as EEV immediately counters with a cannon.</li><li><strong>Dual-Container Alarm:</strong> At 32:02,<ul><li>This boss operates as a system that retaliates almost instantly when attacked, causing Batman to take damage in tandem.<ul><li>Thus, as seen at 32:29, a jump attack while descending is the safest option. Although the video shows successful execution, the boss’s timing may change over time, resulting in a penalty.</li><li>If Batman’s health is sufficient, simply remaining stationary and using punches can clear the challenge with ease.</li></ul></li><li>At 36:24, when one container alarm is destroyed, the remaining one changes its pattern. As seen at 36:41, use the safe left platform to occasionally jump down and employ the spear gun to secure an easy clear.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h3 id=45-cathedral>4.5 Cathedral</h3><ul><li><strong>Overview:</strong><br>After tracking Joker’s conspiracy throughout Gotham City, Batman finally follows the signal of a Secret Transmitter to the <strong>Gotham Cathedral</strong>. This place is Joker’s final stronghold and the setting for Batman’s most intense battle.<ul><li><strong>Stairway:</strong> At 37:11, after entering the cathedral, Batman ascends a narrow, steep spiral staircase surrounded by dark, gray stone walls.<ul><li>At 39:10, there is a section where a wall jump is required. This part is extremely challenging; the video shows a failure, and many YouTube players report difficulties in this section.</li><li>At 39:42, the reversed orientation of the spikes overhead makes this section slightly easier than passages below.</li><li>At 40:15, due to the low height of the landing area, it is hard to clear the jump; repeated attempts and precise timing are essential.<ul><li>At 40:35, once successful, Batman ascends further.</li></ul></li><li>At 40:45, here you can replenish pellet items and health. With that, the confrontation with Firebug draws near.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Firebug:</strong> At 42:32, upon climbing the stairs, Batman reaches the Belltower – the top of the cathedral’s bell tower. In this gothic setting with a massive bell tolling, Joker’s trusted bodyguard, <strong>Firebug</strong>, awaits.<ul><li>At 42:37, Firebug attacks by firing flames and moving at high speed to disorient the player.</li><li>At 42:44, although his attack pattern is simple, you can easily clear him by executing a wall jump combined with batarang attacks.</li></ul></li><li><strong>THE JOKER:</strong> At 43:56, after defeating Firebug, Batman finally comes face-to-face with THE JOKER. The two engage in a final battle on the top floor, with the fate of Gotham City at stake.<ul><li>Thankfully, Batman’s health is restored after the battle with Firebug.</li><li>At 43:58, THE JOKER uses a gun, firing at predictable moments. You can dodge by jumping or by crouching.</li><li>At 44:00, THE JOKER also launches an attack by dropping three lightning bolts from above. Since the lightning falls at fairly regular intervals, positioning yourself appropriately will allow you to evade the strikes. Additionally, performing a stationary jump helps you avoid the electric current flowing along the ground.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><hr><h2 id=5-reviews-and-reception>5. Reviews and Reception</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Critical and Player Response</strong><br>At the time of its release, numerous gaming publications and reviewers hailed the NES version as “one of the greatest superhero games,” praising its challenging difficulty and the depth provided by limited resource management.</p></li><li><p><strong>Game Legacy</strong><br>This game influenced subsequent Batman titles and sequels (e.g., <em>Batman: Return of the Joker</em>) and is still regarded as one of the quintessential classic action games on the NES platform.
