The game features a solid system that combines time-limited stages, rescuing petrified monks, weapon upgrades, armor enhancements, and puzzle-solving elements.</p><hr><h2 id=1-basic-overview-and-release-information>1. Basic Overview and Release Information</h2><p><strong>Risky Woods</strong> is a fantasy-themed side‑scrolling action platformer originally developed by Spain’s Dinamic Software and Zeus Software for the Amiga and released in 1992. It was later ported by Electronic Arts (EA) to the Sega Mega Drive and published in North America and Europe in December 1992, and in Japan under the title <strong>邪神ドラクソス</strong> (Jashin Draxos, <em>Death God Draxos</em>) on February 19, 1993. EA handled distribution in North America and Europe, while the Japanese version was released by EA Victor. The game also saw local releases in Brazil (Tec Toy) and South Korea (Samsung Electronics), where it became known by the phonetic rendering of its Japanese name, <strong>사신 드락소스</strong>.</p><ul><li><strong>Genre:</strong> Action platformer (side‑scrolling)</li><li><strong>Platforms:</strong> Mega Drive/Genesis (port); original on Amiga, Atari ST, DOS, etc.</li><li><strong>Mode:</strong> Single‑player</li><li><strong>Developers:</strong> Dinamic Software, Zeus Software (original); EA (Mega Drive port)</li><li><strong>Publishers:</strong> EA (NA/EU), EA Victor (Japan), Tec Toy (Brazil), Samsung Electronics (Korea)</li><li><strong>Release Dates:</strong><ul><li>North America & Europe: December 1992</li><li>Japan: February 19, 1993</li></ul></li><li><strong>Regional Titles:</strong><ul><li>English‑language markets: <em>Risky Woods</em></li><li>Japan: <em>邪神ドラクソス</em> (Jashin Draxos, “Evil God Draxos”)</li></ul></li></ul><hr><h2 id=2-development-and-production-background>2. Development and Production Background</h2><p>The original <strong>Risky Woods</strong> was created by Spain’s renowned developer Dinamic Software and is known as the studio’s final title before bankruptcy. It holds the distinction of being <strong>the first European computer game ported to the Mega Drive</strong>, part of EA’s effort to bring European PC hits to console audiences. Dinamic Software and Zeus Software—both active in the European Amiga scene—handled the original design and asset creation.</p><p>The Mega Drive conversion was led by EA UK programmer <strong>Steve Wetherill</strong>, who reworked Ricardo Puerto’s level designs and existing graphics to suit the console hardware. Key changes included redesigning the hero’s appearance—from a sleeveless shirt in the Amiga version to a monk‑style tunic and staff in the Mega Drive build—to visually align him with the monks he seeks to rescue. Additionally, the port introduced <strong>new gameplay elements</strong>, notably an armor‑upgrade system, to differentiate it from its PC origins.</p><p>Critics compared Risky Woods’ dark fantasy atmosphere and side‑scrolling action to <strong>Capcom’s Ghosts ’n Goblins</strong> series. However, its larger, more cartoonish sprites earned it the nickname “a kid‑friendly Ghosts ’n Goblins,” and its armor system made it less punishing—armor prevented one‑hit deaths. EA Victor handled the Japanese localization, but its February 1993 release drew little attention, and internal skepticism at EA about its Japan launch contributed to poor sales there. With no sequel, Risky Woods remained a standalone title, and Dinamic Software shuttered soon after due to financial troubles.</p><hr><h2 id=3-game-system-and-features>3. Game System and Features</h2><p>Risky Woods interlocks five core systems—weapon upgrades, defense, key puzzles, statue identification, and time limits—to drive its gameplay loop. Weapons can be upgraded through five types and up to three tiers, while armor is strengthened in stages by collecting Armor Links from defeated foes. Players must gather key fragments to solve door puzzles and advance, all under a strict time limit for each stage.</p><h3 id=31-game-systems-progression-and-weapons>3.1 Game Systems (Progression and Weapons)</h3><p>Risky Woods is a <strong>stage‑clear side‑scrolling action</strong> game. Players control the hero <strong>Rohan</strong>, who must complete each stage within the allotted time. The primary objective is to <strong>destroy all monk statues</strong> to free the good monks turned to stone; only then can Rohan proceed. Some statues conceal <strong>evil monks</strong>, indistinguishable until broken—and unleashing one turns it hostile. On the first run, players must shatter every statue, memorizing the false ones through trial and error. Freeing good monks emits a screen‑clearing blast that damages all enemies, incentivizing quick rescues despite the risk.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Combat and Weapon System:</strong><br>Weapons are dropped by destroyed <strong>Gatekeeper</strong> statues. Each weapon can be upgraded up to <strong>three levels</strong> by collecting duplicates.</p><table class="table table-striped table-bordered gamelog-table"><thead><tr><th>Item</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Axe</td><td>Throws an axe in an arc.</td></tr><tr><td>Boomerang</td><td>Flies in a curve, then returns to Rohan.</td></tr><tr><td>Fireball</td><td>Shoots a fast, straight projectile.</td></tr><tr><td>Magic Dagger</td><td>Functions like a dagger but deals greater damage.</td></tr><tr><td>Morning Star</td><td>Throws a spiked ball along a straight path.</td></tr><tr><td>Golden Potion</td><td>Restores Rohan’s energy (health).</td></tr></tbody></table></li><li><p><strong>Items and Traps:</strong><br>Items appear in treasure chests or drop from defeated monsters.

Detailed Level Structure and Walkthrough</h2><p>The game is divided into four worlds and twelve stages, each world comprising two regular stages and one boss battle. In every stage, you must free all the monk statues and solve key puzzles to open the path forward. Bosses have unique attack patterns, and your approach will vary based on your equipped weapon and armor status.</p><h3 id=40-game-story-synopsis>4.0 Game Story Synopsis</h3><p>For centuries, the ancient monks who protected the world’s wisdom were turned to stone by the demon <strong>Draxos</strong> and his minions. Evil spread and the undead roamed unchecked. You play as the young warrior <strong>Rohan</strong>, who ventures into the cursed forest “Risky Woods” on a mission to <strong>rescue the petrified monks and defeat Draxos</strong>.</p><h3 id=world-1--mountain-pass-stages-13>World 1 – <strong>Mountain Pass</strong> (Stages 1–3)</h3><hr><p><strong>Background:</strong><br>A passage set in a high mountainous region. Rocky cliffs and cave entrances appear in the background, and in some areas of the screen, if you move behind a cliff, the character is rendered as a dark silhouette. The overall atmosphere is that of a desolate mountain path, and spike traps are occasionally placed on the ground, so caution is required.</p><p><strong>Enemies:</strong><br>Since this is the early section, relatively simple foes appear. Skeleton soldiers, slowly shuffling zombies, and crawling Imps are the primary threats, with the occasional flying demon (small red gargoyle) that charges at the player. Their health is not high—just a few dagger strikes will dispatch them—but <strong>they continuously respawn at the edges of the screen</strong>, so if you stay in one spot you’ll be forced into endless combat. As you progress, you’ll find 2–3 monk statues turned to stone; you must destroy each one to free them. Some statues are fake and explode, inflicting heavy damage on Rohan, so manage your health carefully.</p><p><strong>Layout:</strong><br>Stages 1 and 2 are standard left‑to‑right fields. There are <strong>pit traps</strong> at intervals—falling in costs you a chunk of health, respawns you at the last checkpoint, and also costs you Armor Links. Don’t fall in while risking an item. At certain points, eye‑statues (Gatekeepers) block your path: you must collect two <strong>Golden Key</strong> fragments and solve the puzzle in front of each statue to advance. In World 1, the puzzle patterns are relatively short and simple, but a failure costs valuable time, so observe calmly and input the sequence precisely. Clearing a puzzle rewards you with health recovery or weapon items—aim to succeed.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Stage 1:</strong> 00:53 Stage 1 is relatively short and simple, with few enemies and an easy puzzle—ideal for getting accustomed to the game.</p><ul><li>1:53–1:59 The <strong>pit trap</strong> here is an instant kill if you fall through, so be extremely careful—it’s a trap you’ll encounter often. Otherwise, enemies are sparse, so it’s best to pass through rather than engage.</li><li>2:37 The Gatekeeper puzzle you’ll see frequently later: gather two Gate Key fragments and solve the puzzle at this statue to proceed. The pattern is simple in World 1, and success grants health or weapon items—maximize your chances.</li><li>2:59 Be careful when jumping over this section!</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Stage 2:</strong> 3:51 Stage 2 is longer and more complex than Stage 1, with many more enemies—especially <strong>Imps</strong>, which appear frequently. Watch out for <strong>pit traps</strong> and <strong>spike traps</strong>, and solving the statue puzzle here awards the <strong>Boomerang</strong> item.</p><ul><li>4:57 If you’ve collected enough Armor Links, your armor will upgrade as shown here.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Boss (Stage 3):</strong> 7:15 The World 1 boss is a giant <strong>worm/lizard‑type monster</strong>. This bright‑blue worm flies across the screen and uses <strong>fireballs</strong> for ranged attacks. Its difficulty is moderate; the strategy is to <strong>stay close to and beneath the boss</strong>. At 7:35, the boss will rise to avoid you and throw fireballs from above, which you can dodge by remaining underneath. If you rush straight at the boss at the start, it flees upward and only attacks from the screen’s top, allowing Rohan to throw blades upward from the safe zone below. The boss’s weak points are its head or the center of its body; continuous attacks will topple it without any special pattern changes. If you’ve powered up your weapon, you can defeat it quickly.</p></li></ul><hr><h3 id=world-2--hanging-gardens-stages-46>World 2 – <strong>Hanging Gardens</strong> (Stages 4–6)</h3><p><strong>Background:</strong><br>A stage that, as the name suggests, evokes a floating garden or suspended temple. Dense green foliage, columns, and rope‑suspended platforms appear in the background, with brighter and more vibrant colors than World 1. Vertical progression elements—such as jumping between platforms—are more prevalent, creating a more three‑dimensional terrain.</p><p><strong>Enemies:</strong><br>Skeletons and demons similar to those in earlier worlds continue to appear, but a new foe, <strong>shell‑covered floating creatures</strong>, is introduced. When they reach the player’s height, they charge; a single hit causes their shell (carapace) to detach and fall to the ground, while the remaining body floats and attacks again. The discarded shell then automatically explodes after a short delay, scattering shrapnel—avoid standing too close. Additionally, flying <strong>eyeball monsters</strong> appear, firing projectiles from a distance and adding variety to combat.</p><p><strong>Layout:</strong><br>Stages 4 and 5 feature extensive platforming sections. <strong>Rock platforms suspended by ropes</strong> sway or move on a fixed cycle, requiring precise timing to cross—and since a sheer drop lies beneath them, a misstep results in instant death or heavy damage. Enemies also respawn on these platforms, so a strategy of <strong>not stopping and crossing quickly</strong> is essential. Accidentally picking up a skeleton skull or arrow‑trap item during jumps can lead to a fatal fall; thus, <strong>it’s safest to avoid items in aerial platform sections</strong>. Monk statues are typically placed on fixed platforms, and fake statues explode on narrow ledges, making them hard to dodge and causing significant damage. Since these hazards increase starting in World 2, it’s advisable to maintain health by steadily defeating enemies and aiming to obtain <strong>Gold Armor (at least 67 Armor Links)</strong> before proceeding.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Stage 4:</strong> 8:35 No special hazards—focus on managing your health and collecting Armor Links diligently.</p></li><li><p><strong>Stage 5:</strong> 11:27 This stage is more complex than Stage 4, with many moving platforms and numerous enemies.</p><ul><li>11:34 The overhead item cannot be reached immediately. At 12:07, you can backtrack to grab it if you missed it. (There may be a more efficient route.)</li><li>By this point you’ll typically have 99 Armor Links; thereafter, if you simply avoid pitfalls and watch the timer, the stage becomes much easier.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Boss (Stage 6):</strong> 14:54 The World 2 boss is a <strong>worm‑type monster</strong> identical in form to the World 1 boss but accompanied by several <strong>shell‑covered floating creatures</strong> orbiting defensively. The boss’s movement and fireball attacks remain nearly the same, but the <strong>satellite monsters</strong> block your attacks with their bodies. These shell creatures are invulnerable—when struck, they fall briefly then rise again, occasionally dropping in unison in a <strong>row‑crashing pattern</strong> across the ground. Being caught under them inflicts heavy damage, so evade by jumping.</p><ul><li><strong>Strategy:</strong> In the video, the player has stocked up Armor Links and takes no damage. The basic tactic is still to approach and attack the boss, but you must wait for openings when the satellites block your shots. When the orbiting creatures fall, wait until they roll on the ground, then unleash focused attacks on the boss. Since the boss itself isn’t highly durable, concentrating fire before the satellites re-form will defeat it relatively easily. Defeating this boss triggers an interlude animation and transports you to the next world.</li></ul></li></ul><hr><h3 id=world-3--catacombs-stages-79>World 3 – <strong>Catacombs</strong> (Stages 7–9)</h3><p><strong>Background:</strong><br>These are dark, eerie stages set in underground cemeteries or catacombs. In the background, you’ll see piles of skulls, coffins, and subterranean waterways, and because the lighting is dim, some areas limit your visibility. Mechanical traps such as bars shooting out from walls and floor spikes also begin to appear.</p><p><strong>Enemies:</strong><br>Starting in World 3, enemy placement and attack patterns become more vicious. Previous foes appear faster and in greater numbers, and new enemies include <strong>flame‑sheathed skeletal knights</strong>, <strong>swarms of bats</strong>, and <strong>ghostly apparitions</strong>. The flame‑sheathed knights breathe fire forward, making close approach difficult, and ghost enemies can turn transparent to evade attacks. Enemy variety peaks here, but by this point the player likely has powerful weapons and Golden Armor on hand.</p><p><strong>Layout:</strong><br>In Stages 7 and 8, as in earlier worlds, you must solve key puzzles and free monk statues. However, much of the catacomb terrain is a <strong>two‑tiered vertical structure</strong>, making it easy to lose your way. In some sections, doors remain closed the first time you pass; you must backtrack via an alternate route to flip a lever or switch to open the path—an added simple puzzle. Visibility is low, so floor traps and chasms are hard to spot; <strong>in unfamiliar areas, avoid rushing and carefully survey your surroundings</strong>. Delaying risks the timer, so if possible <strong>stockpile Hourglass items</strong> to use when exploring dark zones. Later on, the <strong>Simon‑style puzzles at the key statues lengthen and grow more complex</strong>—in World 3 you may need 4–5 inputs. Stay calm, commit the sequence to memory, and clear the puzzle to win powerful weapons (e.g., Level 3 Power Boomerang).</p><ul><li><strong>Stage 7:</strong> 16:45</li><li><strong>Stage 8:</strong> 19:55<ul><li><strong>21:15</strong> Charging enemies in sections like this can knock you into a pit—be cautious.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Boss (Stage 9):</strong> 22:22<br>The World 3 boss takes a new form: a <strong>giant seahorse‑shaped dragon</strong>. It appears floating at the top of the screen, with a curled, seahorse‑like head and a tail extending down off‑screen. Periodically, it <strong>spews fireballs in an arc</strong>, which land and form vertical columns of flame that block ground approach.<ul><li><strong>Strategy:</strong> The boss floats out of melee reach, so you can only damage it with ranged attacks. When it breathes fire, move to the opposite side to lure the fireballs, then jump over the flames. Between attacks, throw your weapon at its <strong>head</strong>, the only valid hit zone—jumping to arc your shots upward helps. Weapons with special trajectories (e.g., boomerangs, chained blades) are especially effective. If you’ve stockpiled skeleton special attacks (staff skills), unleash them together to rapidly drain the boss’s health.</li><li><strong>Adds:</strong> Throughout the fight, <strong>small mobs</strong> (bats, skeleton soldiers) continuously swarm up from below. Don’t focus solely on the boss—periodically dispatch these adds to avoid being flanked.</li><li>If wearing Golden Armor, you can absorb a few hits from the adds to maintain the offensive, balancing your remaining time and health. Defeating this boss opens the portal to the final world.</li></ul></li></ul><hr><h3 id=world-4--hidden-world-stages-1012>World 4 – <strong>Hidden World</strong> (Stages 10–12)</h3><p><strong>Background:</strong><br>The final area, Hidden World, as the name suggests, has the atmosphere of a hidden otherworld, featuring a gloomy castle and wasteland as its backdrop. The sky is dyed red, and ancient ruins with streams of what appears to be lava or blood flow throughout, creating the impression of being in hell or a demon realm. In‑game, there is no separate world name mentioned before Stage 10, but in the manual and other materials it is called the Hidden World.</p><p><strong>Enemies:</strong><br>It is literally a comprehensive lineup: almost every type of enemy encountered so far makes an appearance. Skeleton knights, demons, eyeball monsters, and ghosts mix in with an extremely high spawn rate. Flying and ground adversaries often appear simultaneously to coordinate attacks on the player. In certain sections, a giant demon hand emerges from the edge of the screen to throw fireballs as a trap‑type enemy; it cannot be destroyed and will cease to appear once you pass that area. You must avoid it and move through quickly.</p><p><strong>Layout:</strong><br>Stages 10 and 11 form the path toward the final boss’s castle, with difficulty at its peak. The time allotted to the player is also very limited, making it impossible to hesitate even for a moment. The puzzle statue patterns become maximally complex; success grants significant rewards (such as full health restoration), but failure makes clearing nearly impossible due to time constraints. Therefore, in the Hidden World, quickly solving the key puzzles is vital for survival. If you know statue locations in advance, you can, upon their appearance, immediately check for keys and prepare for the puzzle. Monk statues also appear in later sections, but most are fake and, when freed, become enemies and attack you; if your health is low, you do not need to break them all. In the Hidden World, clearing only the key puzzles that open doors automatically advances you to the next stage, so you can ignore fake monk statues without hindering progress. However, be careful not to miss the real monk statues, or you may fail the stage completion conditions.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Stage 10:</strong> 23:49</p><ul><li>25:07 If you’re not focused, you won’t notice the barrel and the overlapping Gate Key item on the right.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Stage 11:</strong> 26:33</p><ul><li>27:15 This is a section prone to fatal falls, so clear enemies before proceeding. In the video, a Lightning item was used to traverse it.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Boss (Stage 12, Final Boss Draxos):</strong> 28:55<br>Draxos appears as a massive demon figure filling the screen, rooted inside the castle in an almost motionless, fixed form, looking down at the player with only his upper body visible. What makes Draxos most terrifying is his infinitely spawning minions: winged demons emerge continuously from a hole in his massive belly to attack the player. These small demons have low health but spawn so rapidly they feel like a barrage, and Draxos himself occasionally fires energy orbs for direct attacks.</p><ul><li><strong>Strategy:</strong> Since Rohan’s attacks are faster than Draxos’s infinitely spawning minions, you can clear the fight by attacking relentlessly without pause. You don’t even need to jump. (This applies to the Amiga version as well.) In fact, once Rohan has Golden Armor, the difficulty is effectively meaningless.</li></ul></li></ul><hr><h2 id=5-reception-and-reviews>5. Reception and Reviews</h2><p>Risky Woods received <strong>mixed feedback</strong> at launch. Praised for <strong>superb graphics and presentation</strong>, its rich 16‑bit palette, large sprites, detailed backgrounds, and smooth animations impressed many. Effects like silhouette shadows behind walls drew acclaim. The soundtrack and SFX were noted for “catchy, upbeat rhythms,” and the overall presentation met period standards.</p><p>On the flip side, critics pointed to its <strong>harsh difficulty design</strong>: short time limits paired with endless enemy respawns created relentless pressure. Frequent hits during jumps, combined with tight timers, led many to call it unforgiving. A UK magazine wrote, “Repeated hits costing Armor Links before you can react is deeply frustrating,” and Electronic Gaming Monthly in the US gave scores as low as 4/10. In France and other European markets, however, some outlets rated it in the 80s—opinions diverged by region.</p><p><strong>Japanese Market Reaction:</strong> In BEEP! Mega Drive reader polls, <strong>Jashin Draxos</strong> ranked at the bottom, famously outplacing <em>Sword of Sodan</em> as the worst title. Players mockingly dubbed it “trash, as the name suggests.” High price (¥8,900 plus tax) and late release further hurt sales. Though partly hyperbole, perception was overwhelmingly negative.</p><p><strong>Modern Reappraisal:</strong> Decades later, Risky Woods is considered a <strong>cult classic with both strengths and flaws</strong>. Retro reviewers highlight its “unique mechanics (respawning enemies, Simon puzzles) [as] polarizing.” Spain’s HobbyConsolas named it among the country’s “greatest games,” underscoring its historical significance as one of the first Spanish titles on console. While never a blockbuster, its distinct systems and challenge have earned it a devoted fanbase.</p><hr><h2 id=6-additional-information-and-sequels>6. Additional Information and Sequels</h2><p>There is <strong>no direct sequel</strong>. Dinamic Software folded in 1993 after this release (<a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/2063/risky-woods/#:~:text=,ported%20to%20a%20console%20system" target=_blank rel=noopener>MobyGames</a>). Some staff formed <strong>Dinamic Multimedia</strong>, but no follow‑up used the Risky Woods IP. Rumors of a late‑’90s PC remake or 3D sequel never materialized. The original resurfaced during the retro revival: Piko Interactive re‑released a DOS‑emulated PC (Steam) version in February 2023 with filters and save support, and in 2024 it appeared on the Antstream streaming service. It has not been included in any console mini‑editions, though ROMs circulate among enthusiasts.</p><p>Comparable titles include Capcom’s Ghosts ’n Goblins series and the Mega Drive’s <em>Jewel Master</em>, both featuring time‑limit progression. Zeus Software later pivoted to PC development, while EA’s early ’90s external ports (e.g. <em>Sword of Sodan</em>) often drew harsh reviews.</p><p>Risky Woods’ legacy is as an <strong>experimental European‑to‑console port</strong>, testing the viability of PC action games on 16‑bit hardware—an ambitious endeavor despite its commercial failure.</p><hr><h2 id=7-conclusion-and-summary>7. Conclusion and Summary</h2><p>The <strong>Mega Drive version of Risky Woods</strong> is a visually striking side‑scroller with innovative systems that suffered from <strong>uneven difficulty tuning</strong>, limiting its success. Over twelve stages, Rohan’s quest to free petrified monks and vanquish the demon Draxos combines tight timers, infinite respawns, and memory puzzles—creating intense gameplay but a steep entry barrier. Western and Japanese versions share nearly identical gameplay, though Japan’s HUD fonts were simplified and marketing support was minimal. Still, Risky Woods stands as proof of Spanish developers’ capabilities and continues to attract players with its unique mechanics. In short: <strong>“Outstanding graphics and inventive systems, tempered by challenging difficulty.”</strong> Mastering its strategies and power‑ups yields a rewarding, fast‑paced experience; without preparation, expect frustration.</p><hr><h2 id=8-hidden-elements-cheats-and-easter-eggs>8. Hidden Elements (Cheats and Easter Eggs)</h2><p>The Mega Drive Risky Woods has few official cheats, but you can unlock a <strong>Stage Select</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Stage Select Cheat:</strong> After a game over, enter <strong>“EOA”</strong> on the high‑score name entry screen (requires a qualifying score). “EOA” references Electronic Arts. Then, in the Options menu, “Sound Test” changes to “Stage Select.” Choose stages 01–12 to start there, with gold armor and 99 Armor Links—score resets to zero and the ending may differ from normal play.</li></ul><p>No other widely documented secrets exist. A minor localization detail: the Japanese release uses simpler HUD fonts for legibility, without affecting gameplay. Rumors persist of hard‑to‑clear bugs in certain Japanese ROM lots, but nothing official confirms this.</p><p>To conquer Risky Woods without cheats: <strong>farm Armor Links for defense, manage your time carefully, avoid trap items, and solve key puzzles swiftly.</strong> With these tips, you may uncover the hidden enjoyment in this cult classic.</p></section></main></div><footer class="py-3 mt-auto bg-light"><div class="container py-1 my-1"><div class="d-flex flex-wrap justify-content-between align-items-center"><p class="col-md mb-0 text-muted"></p><ul class="nav col-md-auto justify-content-end"></ul></div></div></footer><script src=/js/bootstrap/bootstrap.bundle.min.min.fde1bce9cb450c8f28624f696a2e289585ba452e38625ed326071c43be323d194b7f426b132c66f8a5686a3b57013f66a42148f04b208da3ed7d26710b23a763.js integrity="sha512-/eG86ctFDI8oYk9pai4olYW6RS44Yl7TJgccQ74yPRlLf0JrEyxm+KVoajtXAT9mpCFI8EsgjaPtfSZxCyOnYw==" crossorigin=anonymous defer></script><script src=/js/main.min.ef1f28a8056cd6d7212a8b5b00d407c69b132da406abf05851fa3c50576a2952c8303479a1f73a0828ab2f81b3885d0b7fae2e612d2a2b0b3c5f4898e389e87c.js integrity="sha512-7x8oqAVs1tchKotbANQHxpsTLaQGq/BYUfo8UFdqKVLIMDR5ofc6CCirL4GziF0Lf64uYS0qKws8X0iY44nofA==" crossorigin=anonymous></script><script src=https://www.youtube.com/iframe_api async defer></script></body></html>
